Individual and Group Recommender Systems for X-Wines Dataset

dataset taken from https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/x-wines


Individual Recommender:

- individual_baseline.ipynb is the file with our baseline model, that uses cosine similarity, for the individual recommeder, and includes its evaluation
- individual_evaluation.ipynb is the file with our individual recommender model and its evaluation results.
- individual_gui.py is the file with the interface to our individual recommender system. The GUI is made with Streamlit, so you need it installed to run it.


Group Recommeder:

- group_recommeder.ipynb is the file with our group recommender system, and group_recommender_algs.py is the same code but in a python file, used for the gui.
- group_gui.py is the file with the interface to our group recommender system. The GUI is made with Streamlit, so you need it installed to run it.
- group_baseline_gui.py is the file with the interface to our individual baseline recommender system. The GUI is made with Streamlit, so you need it installed to run it.
- group_baseline_evaluation.ipynb is the file with our baseline group recommender system.
